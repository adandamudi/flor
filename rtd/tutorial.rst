Tutorial
========

Flor is a *context-centric* logger and automatic version controller.
Context is enriched metadata: it is also the **version history** and **lineage** of data or other artifacts or entities
in the Machine Learning lifecycle. Flor leverages git for version control and relies on program analysis for establishing
the lineage of metrics or output artifacts from data, code, and parameters.
Flor uses the Ground context meta-model (`Figure 2 <http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf>`_).
You can read more about the motivation for Flor in our workshop `paper <https://rlnsanz.github.io/dat/Flor_CMI_18_CameraReady.pdf>`_.
